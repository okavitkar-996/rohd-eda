This repo enable the ROHD language to be able to work with IPXact standard.

IP-XACT describes the meta-data of IP designs and flows and the interconnection of IP interfaces in a standard specification. The IP-XACT extension mechanism supports user-defined vendor features to implement specific tool or flow features, such as to store vendor-specific IP meta-data like GUI-related data. These new extensions published by Accellera enable cross-company IP-XACT usage in emerging areas of design such as analog-mixed signal; physical design planning; and power.


Following is IPXAct user guide that can be used as referance.
